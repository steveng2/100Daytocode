In 2019 I am to improve my coding skills. This year I have taken the 100dayofcode challenge.  For the next 100days of code, I will code for 1 hour a day minimum. The steps that I will be taking. 

1) I will document my learning each week on Thursday.  And explain how my journey is going.

2) I aim to get a better understanding of Python and Javascript with frameworks  like Bootstrap,  wow.js and other.  

3) Work on Javascript at Freecodecamp.org and complete the FrontEnd certificate at FreeCodeCamp.

4) Learn 3 algorithm and how to use them in a project.

5) Finished Web Dev path at Codecademy. 

The basic rules are code every day for the next 100 day.
